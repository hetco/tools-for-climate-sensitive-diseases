                            <p>After searching PubMed for papers published over the last 10 years, using a customized API and keywords for scoping climate and health software, we found only 37 fully developed and named tools.</p>

                            <p>This suggests that few studies progress from providing the initial evidence of climate-health linkages to the operationalization of a decision support tool that could inform actions to reduce the burden of disease. Our qualitative research indicated that this might be due to lack of incentives for academics to publish full models, and lack of multi-disciplinary communities which bring together scientists and software developers.</p>

                            <p>Although only 37 tools met our full list of characteristics, we found several models of climate and infectious disease that had well described, freely accessible model outputs but no access to code repositories.</p> 

                            <p>Examples of two such models were an Aedes mosquito model from Ryan et al. (2019)<span class="reference_number">1</span>, and a dengue climate forecasting model from Lowe et al. (2021)<span class="reference_number">2</span>. The former had no associated code repository and the later had no named software platform. Both models can potentially be developed into software packages or platforms.</p>

                            There are useful models and codes associated with publications that exist on online repositories like GitHub, but there is a gap in translating this research into automated, packaged tools. Researchers who are developing these models can be connected to software engineers. An investment in these validated models could result in the rapid creation of new tools.</p>

                            <p>The majority of tools identified in our review (81.1%) focused on vector-borne disease systems. Only 10% of modeling tools were applied to infectious diseases with other modes of transmission, including respiratory (5.4%), foodborne (2.7%), and waterborne (2.7%).

                            <p>The closest match was <a href="http://seeg-oxford.github.io/ebola-spread/global-risk">Ebola-Spread</a><span class="reference_number">3</span>, a predictive niche modelling tool from Oxford University. The associated github repository has incomplete code, requiring the user to have the data inputs that are not specified or linked, and the repository itself was not upto date, meaning it is effectively unusable.</p>

                            Transitioning research to public health practise must be accounted for from the project outset since the data that feed into the model and the model output (e.g., interfaces) need to align with decision making processes identified by public health professionals. To achieve this, transdisciplinary project teams can include academic partners with sectoral partners, to ensure that researchers and end-users co-create models, eliminating the last mile problem.

                            <p>Most tools were developed for, and implemented in geographic areas where the infectious disease of interest is currently endemic. The tools found in this review had been implemented in several WHO regions, spanning Africa (43.8%), the Americas (14.6%), Europe (10.4%), the Western Pacific (10.4)%, South-East Asia (6.3%), and the Eastern Mediterranean (2.1%). Four tools (8.3%) did not focus on a single geographic region, but rather a global study.</p>
                            <p>A recent study showed tropical highland areas in the African region, the Eastern Mediterranean region, and the region of the Americas could experience an annual increase in the number of months that are climatically suitable months for malaria transmission by the end of the century -- an increase of about 1.6 months per year<span class="reference_number">5</span>. Tropical lowland areas in the Western Pacific region and the Eastern Mediterranean region will experience the greatest increase in climatic suitability for dengue transmission by approximately 4 additional months per year. Without bold action to curb emissions, the population at risk of both diseases is predicted to increase by an additional 4·7 billion people, particularly in lowlands and urban areas. These findings are consistent with other estimates that dengue transmission could newly impact an additional 1 billion people by 2080, with the largest increases in the western European region<span class="reference_number">6</span>. It is estimated that an additional 1.3 billion people will be at risk of Zika fever by 2050, with different regions experiencing  an increase in risk depending on the climate scenario (e.g., Eastern sub-Saharan Africa experiencing the largest increase in risk under RCP 8.5, and North America experiencing the highest under RCP 4.5)<span class="reference_number">7</span>.</p>
                            <p>There is a need for modeling tools that address disease dynamics in zones of current or future emergence, as indicated by the projected shift in the burden of climate-sensitive disease transmission under climate change scenarios.</p>
                            <p>There is also an opportunity to cross-pollinate knowledge and experiences between regions that are currently endemic for climate sensitive diseases and regions of projected disease emergence due to climate change.</p>

                            <p>Tools are needed for regions where the climate-driven risk of infectious disease transmission will increase substantially (zones of emergence) due to climate change, demographic shifts, and other factors.</p>

                            <p>We identified large variations in the spatial and temporal scale of the 37 tools.</p> 

                            <p>The spatial scale of tools, which includes geographic extent and unit of model output, varied considerably for tools in our final list. Model scales ranged from highly localized foci (8.1%), for example simulations for individual villages, to tools with a global or continental extent (16.2%).</p> 
                            <p>Some examples of local tools from our final list include ANOSPEX, SLIM, and FleaTickRisk, while MARA, Vibrio Map Viewer, and the albopictus package operate on broader, continental scales.</p> 

                            <p>The ideal scale of tool is dependent on goals; local tools may be limited in terms of where they can be operationalized, and their transferability, while being well validated locally. Tools with very coarse resolutions may aid broad planning efforts, but be of limited use to local stakeholders. The takeaway here is that there is no “best” scale for models, and it is important to encourage models at different scales to help facilitate decision-making at different granularities.</p>

                            <p>Few models forecast disease risk beyond the seasonal climate outlook.</p>
